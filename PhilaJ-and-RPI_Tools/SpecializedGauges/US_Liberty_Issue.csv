# Liberty Issue Perforation Gauge
#
# Right now the gap values are closest Kiusalas gauge values, and the
# hole sizes are based on measurements of my own collection.  I have a
# project on my to-do list to adjust these values based on
# measurements of my own collection.
#
# Hole to hole distance (gap) formula:
#            gap=20/perf     -- (perf units: holes per 2cm)
#            gap=mils*0.0254 -- (mils units: thousandths of an inch)
