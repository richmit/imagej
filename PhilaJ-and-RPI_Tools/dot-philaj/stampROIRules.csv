# Stamp ROI Rules
#
# The idea is to define handy rules that can automatically create ROIs (i.e. selections in ImageJ) given a
# reference point.  Usually that reference point is the upper left design frame corner.  This file is a CSV with
# each line describing a single rule.  The first column is the "name" of the rule.  This name is what appears in
# the menus presented by PhilaJ.  The second column is an ROI name.  This will be used to name the ROI after it is
# created -- so you could hit "T" to add it to the ROI Manager and have a nice name.  The remainder of the items on
# the line describe a set of selections that will be joined together (as if they were drawn with the "shift" key
# down.  Each selection is a semicolon separated list of parameters: Selection type (rectangle or polygon), and a
# list of numbers to define the selection.  The numbers are all in millimeters, and are offset by the "reference
# point".  For a rectangle the parameters are x, y, width, and height.  For a polygon, the list is of variable size
# and consists of x & y coordinates for the vertexes.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments
